#Neural Network Structure
Neural network with Input layer (nodes - based on words trained), 1 hidden layer (10 nodes) and Output layer (1 node)

#Steps implemented
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Bag of words approach
3. Increase accuracy - Binary Vector representation
4. Increase Computation Speed
5. Further Enhance Accuracy
6. Analysing behaviour of Weights
